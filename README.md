## Sentiment Analysis Web Application 

This project will be a web application that houses a sentiment analysis machine learning model. Given on a word, it will scrape data off of social media sites such as reddit twitter, etc. and give a sentiment analysis on whether the given word has a positive or negative outlook with a corresponding percentage in the checked social media sites.

The NLP Machine Learning Model will be operated off of a Flask Backend with Python and will be implemented with a RESTful API. The specific model is TBD with a pretrained model as a base/placeholder and a custom model hopefully in the workings.
The minimum viable product will consist of an off the shelf pre-trained and pre-tuned model. The following iteration will have a pre-trained model with custom tuned hyper-parameters. For the last iteration, a custom trained and tuned tensorflow model will be attempted. 

## Starting/Setting up production app

Need to start the python backend server first, then connect to the react front end second
python backend address is defined in package.json as https://localhost:5000/
react front end is defined as http://localhost:3000/

## Debugging

If anything buggy happens like react scripts not being recognized do:
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
