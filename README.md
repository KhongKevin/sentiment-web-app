## Sentiment Analysis Web Application

This project will be a web application that houses a sentiment analysis machine learning model. Given on a word, it will scrape data off of social media sites such as reddit twitter, etc. and give a sentiment analysis on whether the given word has a positive or negative outlook with a corresponding percentage in the checked social media sites.

The Machine Learning Model will be operated off of a Flask Backend with Python and will be implemented with a RESTful API. The specific model is TBD with a pretrained model as a base/placeholder and a custom model hopefully in the workings.

## Setup Run

Need to start the python backend server first, then connect to the react front end second
python backend address is defined in package.json as https://localhost:5000/
react front end is defined as http://localhost:3000/

## Programs/libraries needed to install for development
- Tortoise Git
- Git 
- Visual Studio Code
- javascript/react
- material ui 


## Debugging

> If anything buggy happens like react scripts not being recognized do:
rm -rf node_modules && npm install

This project was inspired by a fellow classmate and their capstone project which seems like it would have useful and interesting applications.
